This Python code creates a drawing application using tkinter, providing a user interface with a toolbar to select colors, brush sizes, and various drawing tools. Users can draw shapes, text, and freehand lines on a canvas, with options to undo, redo, save, and load drawings. The application supports grid visibility toggling and smooth drawing options, and includes keyboard shortcuts for common actions. The code sets up the canvas, toolbar, and status bar to facilitate interactive drawing and editing.
